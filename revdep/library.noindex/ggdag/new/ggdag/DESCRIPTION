Description: Tidy, analyze, and plot directed acyclic graphs
    (DAGs). 'ggdag' is built on top of 'dagitty', an R package that uses
    the 'DAGitty' web tool (<http://dagitty.net>) for creating and
    analyzing DAGs. 'ggdag' makes it easy to tidy and plot 'dagitty'
    objects using 'ggplot2' and 'ggraph', as well as common analytic and
    graphical functions, such as determining adjustment sets and node
    relationships.
