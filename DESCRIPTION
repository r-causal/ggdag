Description: Tidy, analyze, and plot directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
    'ggdag' is built on top of 'dagitty', an R package that uses the
    'DAGitty' web tool (<http://dagitty.net>) for creating and analyzing
    DAGs. 'ggdag' makes it easy to tidy and plot 'dagitty' objects using
    'ggplot2' and 'ggraph', as well as common analytic and graphical
    functions, such as determining adjustment sets and node relationships.
